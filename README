This is a SpeakEasy extension that allows the user to apply their own personal stylesheets to a Confluence site.

It allows you to edit and save individual stylesheets for various contexts. eg: to apply everywhere, or just to a
specific wiki page or space, or even just to the dashboard page.

When installed and enabled in SpeakEasy, it provides a new menu item 'Stylicious' in your user menu. This will open
an editing window, from which you can select the context from the left hand side and enter your custom CSS in the
textarea on the right.

Your custom CSS is currently saved into the browser localStorage facility.
